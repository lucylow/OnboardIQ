# OnboardIQ: Executive Summary for Hackathon Judges

## The Problem: A Three-Alarm Fire in Customer Onboarding

**75% of users abandon products they can't understand within a week.** The "aha moment" window has shrunk to under two days. Meanwhile, **identity fraud surged 42% in 2024**, costing businesses over $10 billion, yet **54% of SMBs don't use basic MFA** because it's too complex.

## The Pitch: Why OnboardIQ Wins

"Judges, we're not just building a better onboarding flow; we're building a **strategic moat** that protects revenue, builds trust, and enables scale. In today's market, this isn't a nice-to-have. It's a survival essential.

Our integrated approach solves three expensive, urgent problems with a single platform. We make **robust security the effortless default** with Vonage. We use **AI to personalize the journey** and slash time-to-value. And we **automate the entire document process** with Foxit, freeing up teams to focus on growth.

The timing is perfect: 73% of businesses use SaaS, but only 54% have proper security, and 84% see revenue increases when they improve customer experience. We're entering a $6.8 billion market growing at 22% annually, where the leading player only has 13.5% market share.

This isn't just a viable business—it's a necessary evolution of how companies think about customer onboarding in an AI-first, security-conscious world."
